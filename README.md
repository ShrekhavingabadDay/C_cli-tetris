Unix terminal based tetris game with ncurses written in C.

*My second C project, full of bugs, the code isn't the cleanest, but it works. (Any contribution is more than welcome!)*

# Compilation

Compile with: `gcc -o name_of_executable cli-tetris.c -lncurses`

or use `make name=the_name_for_this_program_your_heart_desires`
